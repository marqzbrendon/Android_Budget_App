# Overview

This is an Android app version of the budget app I created using Kotlin (see https://github.com/marqzbrendon/BudgetApp).

This app is intended to be used by me to control my personal finances. The app is not yet completed (important features like deleting and editing data are still not available).

The YouTube video below explains the basic functionalities of the app.
